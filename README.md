# Distributed System Project

## Install
```
brew install thrift
brew install gradle
```

NOTE for later OS X, `brew` install things on `/usr/local`, which is not in the default GUI application PATH variable. 
To fix this, refer to [this article](http://depressiverobot.com/2016/02/05/intellij-path.html) to set a proper PATH variable
 so that the thrift compiler can be found inside IntelliJ.
